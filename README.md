# Digital Design

- All of the code is written in Verilog Hardware Description Language

## Lab 1
### Half Adder  
- A module which returns the sum and carry of two one-bit inputs

## Lab 2 
### Full Adder 
- A module which returns the sum and carry of three one-bit inputs
### Four Bit Adder
- A module which adds two four-bit inputs using multiple full adder modules

## Lab 3  
### Four Bit Adder Display
- A module which adds two four-bit inputs and displays the output on a seven-segment display

## Lab 4
### Adder/Subtractor
- A module which works as a four-bit adder as well as a four-bit subtractor based on a selection line input

## Lab 6
### Two-bit Multiplier
- A module which takes two two-bit inputs and multiplies them
### Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- A module which implements an ALU performing 8 different functions on two four-bit inputs based on different selection line inputs

## Lab 7
### Shift Register
- A module that implements a parallel access shift register on a four-bit input and performs multiple functions, like left shift, right shift, and two bit shifts based on different selection line inputs

## Lab 8
### Shift Adder
- A module which takes two four-bit inputs and sums them using a serial adder and displays the sum on the same place where one of the inputs was displayed.
